			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt=""></span>Developed a new interior rearview mirror, launching an injection molded rear housing, two laser-cut glass elements, a die-cut foam tape, and a new PCB. This product is a continuation of the new rearview mirror construction I developed here. Relative to that construction, this mirror required glass resizing,  an updated connection interface, and updated PCB locating scheme, and new customer and regulatory validation. These changes required a DFMEA, tolerance stack ups, thermal expansion analysis, and careful review of updated customer requirements.  </p>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt=""></span>In addition to the standard analyses above, the snap in the connection interface required static FEA to verify installation and retention force, as well as to confirm the stress limits of the resin material were not exceeded. I conducted CATIA analyses to verify this, confirming the initial analysis with the company's FEA expert. I also conducted early prototyping work to verify regulatory compliance, resulting in prompt tool changes to enable us to keep to the initial Gantt schedule. This product is currently undergoing validation and manufacturing trials.</p>
