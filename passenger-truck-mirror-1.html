            <p class="major">Led mechanical design for a new passenger truck exterior auto-dimming mirror. This was a LH only mirror development - many vehicles put a dimming mirror only on the driver side, as that is where the primary glare comes from.</p>

                        Development of a new exterior rearview mirror, launching an injection molded carrier, two laser-cut glass elements, a heated adhesive foam, and a wire harness. This product also uses the BSM I developed
                        <a href="lighted-blind-spot-module">here</a>.
                        This product and
                        <a href="passenger-truck-mirror-2">this</a>
                        product were coincident launches (one is for the standard variant of the truck, and one for the trailer tow variant). This resulted in a high workload for me - but still the same timeframe! As my first solo product launch, I had to learn fast and ask lots of questions.
                        <br>
                        For these launches, I led DFMEA reviews, conducted many tolerance analyses, and did iterative 3D printing to ensure the wire routing was clear and easy for manufacturing. Of particular interest to me during this project was learning about the design of the heated foam that is in between the glass and the plastic carrier. This heater melts ice on and/or defrosts the mirror within a matter of minutes, something I wish I had back in frigid Minnesota. </p>

                    <!--<h4>Right</h4>-->

                        Shown on the right is a modal analysis conducted for this mirror. This finds the resonant
                        frequencies for the mirror, enabling a prediction of how well the rearview image will resist
                        "blurring" due to
                        road or acoustical vibrations. The new construction of this mirror allows for excellent
                        vibrational performance. <br>
                        Beyond the mechanical innovation leading to better vibration performance (and other improvements), this product also had innovation in its' electronic and manufacturing aspects.
                        Because
                        of this multifaceted nature, I had constant collaboration with the above teams, as well as
                        program and project management. Many of the validation tests for this product are intended to
                        simulate a vehicle lifetime, and so, even when accelerated, have long lead times. This meant
                        that there was little room for error in the product timeline. This product has successfully
                        completed validation and is in final manufacturing trials.</p>
